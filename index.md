<I>Example results achieved with the GAN. From left to right: the original SDSS image, the degraded image with a worse PSF and higher noise level (indicating the PSF and noise level used), the image as recovered by the GAN, and for comparison, the result of a deconvolution. This figure visually illustrates the GAN's ability to recover features which conventional deconvolutions cannot.</I>
